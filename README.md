# NTHU-OldJay

NTHU-OldJay includes the solutions I can find or reproduce (if missing) to the old NTHU Online Judge (OJ) problems I was faced with as I learned to programme in NTHU. These may include the problems from Introduction to Programming (I) and (II), Data Structure, and some other questions that I have practiced on the OJ system.

Steps of this project:

1. [x] Importing all the codes from 2015~2018 that I have ever submitted to OJ.
2. [x] Improving the implementation by editing and retesting it on the OJ to make sure the codes work.
    1. [x] I2P (I)
    2. [x] I2P (II)
    3. [x] Data Structure
    4. [x] Others
3. [x] Move everything out of the folders

If something goes wrong please let me know, I will look into it. You are free to use any of the codes of NTHU-OldJay.

## Missing list

The following are the list of codes that are missing or stored at a place not accessible to me. If the questions are still complete, reproducing the codes may be attempted.
