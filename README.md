# NTHU-OldJay

NTHU-OldJay includes the solutions to the old NTHU Online Judge(OJ) problems I was faced with as I learned to programme in NTHU. These may include the problems from Introduction to Programming (I) and (II), Data Structure, and some other questions that I have practiced on the OJ system.

Steps of this project:

1. [x] Importing all the codes from 2015~2018 that I have ever submitted to OJ.
2. [ ] Improving the implementation by editing and retesting it on the OJ to make sure the codes work.
    1. [x] I2P (I)
    2. [ ] I2P (II)
    3. [ ] Data Structure
    4. [x] Others

If something goes wrong please let me know, I will look into it. You are free to use any of the codes of NTHU-OldJay.
